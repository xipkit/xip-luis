# LUIS NLP Xip Kit Component

This integration implements the [Microsoft LUIS](https://luis.ai) Language Understanding service. It utilizes the built-in NLP features part of Xip 2.x. If you are still using Xip 1.x, you will first need to upgrade to Xip 2.x before you can use this integration.

## Configuration

For instructions on how to configure your Azure account signup for LUIS, please reference their docs. You won't have to set this anywhere, but this gem does utilize the latest `v3` LUIS API version.

Once your account is setup, these are the configuration settings you will need to add to you `services.yml` file:

```yaml
default: &default
  nlp_integration: luis
  luis:
    endpoint: westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com
    app_id: 9434fbd8-420b-6d75-8a6f-b6c9a0ac5ec0
    subscription_key: 1b69a4b9db669805b4fcba5f1f2f87bb
    tz_offset: 0
    intent_threshold: 0.2

production:
  <<: *default
development:
  <<: *default
test:
  <<: *default
```

Xip will automatically use your `staging` LUIS slot in development and staging environments and will use the `production` slot for your production Xip environment.

That's it! Xip will now automatically use LUIS for intent detection and entity extraction automatically via `handle_message` and `get_match`.

## Intents

We recommend you name your intents using snake case (`snake_case`). This is because this integration will automatically convert your intent names to Ruby symbols.

So for example, if you have a `handle_message` defined like this:

```ruby
handle_message(
  'Maybe' => proc { step_to state: :say_maybe },
  :yes => proc { step_to state: :say_yes },
  :no => proc { step_to state: :say_no }
)
```

If your user responds with a variation of the string `maybe`, then they will be taken to the state `say_maybe`.

Otherwise, the intent named `yes` and the intent named `no` will attempt to be matched. So if you had named your intent `YES` for example, you'd have to use `:YES` here which doesn't match Ruby syntax conventions.

For more info about how intents are matched, please see the [Xip Kit NLP documentation](https://docs.xipkit.com/nlp).

### intent_threshold

This is the real number that respresents the minimum threshold required for an intent to match. So if for example your `intent_threshold` is set to `0.2`, if the top intent scores `0.09`, it will not be returned as a match.

## Entities

The entity types listed below are named using their corresponding Xip type. The equivalent type used by Microsoft LUIS is also listed. For each code sample, the sample query is first provided followed by the array of entities extracted from the queries (for the given type).

It's possible, and even likely, that a query matches more than one entity type. For example, a `currency` type will also match a `number` type. For more info about how to utilize these types, please see the [Xip Kit NLP documentation](https://docs.xipkit.com/nlp).

### number

LUIS prebuilt entity: `number`

```ruby
"I think it was something like 63 or maybe 764"

[
  15000

```ruby
"You can reach me at 313-555-1212"

[
  "313-555-1212"
]
```

For more info about these values, please reference the [phonenumber entity LUIS documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-reference-prebuilt-phonenumber?tabs=V3).

LUIS prebuilt entity: `percentage`

```ruby
"The stock is up 8.9% today"

[
  8.9
]
```

### age

"81 years old"

]

```

### datetime

LUIS prebuilt entity: `datetimeV2`

This one is the most complicated one to work with. The values are nested pretty deeply. This integration exposes the values at such a high level because there is a chance that LUIS will return results for more than one date type. For example, below we have just one result of type `date`, but LUIS could return more than one object of subtype `daterange`, `time`, `timerange`, etc. See the docs for more info about these subtypes.

```ruby
"How about Mar 12?"

[
  {
    "type": "date",
    "values": [
      {
        "timex": "XXXX-03-12",
        "resolution": [
          {
            "value": "2019-03-12"
          },
          {
            "value": "2020-03-12"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

For more info about these values, please reference the [datetimeV2 entity LUIS documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/luis/luis-reference-prebuilt-datetimev2?tabs=1-1%2C2-1%2C3-1%2C4-1%2C5-1%2C6-1#types-of-datetimev2).

### duration

LUIS prebuilt domain entity: `Calendar.Duration`

```ruby
"it will be between 15 minutes and 3 hours"

  "3 hours"
]
```

_Additional docs for this prebuilt domain entitiy is not available_

### key_phrase

```ruby
"I need to find the instructional materials for the course"

[
  "instructional materials",
  "course"
]
```
